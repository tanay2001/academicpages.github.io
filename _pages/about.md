I'm a third year undergraduate in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Madras. I am currently working as an undegraduate researcher under [Prof. Mitesh Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) at the Robert Bosch Center for Data Science and AI, IIT Madras.<br> My research interests mainly lie in the applications of Deep learning to Natural Language Processing. Currently I am working on studying the vulnerabilities of systems from various adversarial perspectives, quantifying and analyzing the robustness of models.<br>

Apart from my research work, I am also the head of the [Analytics Club](https://github.com/analytics-club-iitm) at IIT Madras, it's one of the most active and sought after clubs in the University that works on topics pertaining to AI. We actively work to solve social problems by leveraging tools from ML. For further info visit our Github organization(We try our best to keep it upto-date ;) <br> <br> Previously, I have got the opportunity to contribute immensely to some early staged startups namely BlueBarrel Solutions in the US and NikkOtto at IITM. I also interned at Subex, Banglore where I worked with V&L models with aim of automating the inovice verfication proceess. <br><br>
