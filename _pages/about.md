I'm a senior undergraduate in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Madras. My research interests mainly lie in the applications of Deep Learning to various settings like Natural Language Processing. I am interested in studying the vulnerabilities of systems, quantifying and analyzing the robustness of models. <br> During my junior year, I interned remotely at the University of Washington's [H2lab](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/), where I worked with [Bhargavi Paranjape](https://bhargaviparanjape.github.io/) and [Prof. Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/) on topics related to counterfactual data augmentation in NLP. I spent my summer 2022 interning at [USC Information Science Institute](https://www.isi.edu/). I was part of the [LUKA Lab](https://luka-group.github.io/), where I worked with [Prof. Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/), [Fei Wang](https://feiwang96.github.io/), and [Ehsan Qasemi](https://proska.github.io/) on improving the factuality of abstractive summarization systems. Currently as part of my Btech thesis, I'm working with [Prof. Mitesh Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) on tackling problems related to developing and analyzing systems for low-resource Indian Languages

Aside from my research, I was the head of the [Analytics Club](https://github.com/analytics-club-iitm) at IIT Madras for '21-22; it's one of the most active and sought-after groups in the University, working actively to affect real-world problems by utilizing Machine Learning. For further info visit our Github organization. I still continue to contribute by being a memeber of the Student Council.<br> <br> Previously, I have got the opportunity to contribute immensely to some early staged startups namely BlueBarrel Solutions and NikkOtto. I also interned at [Subex](https://www.subex.com/ai-labs/) where I worked with Vision & Language models with aim of automating the invoice verification process. <br><br>
