I'm a thrid year undergraduate in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Madras. I am currently working as an undegraduate researcher under [Prof Mitesh Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) at the Robert Bosch Center for Data Science, IIT Madras. My intrerets mainly lie in Natural Language Processing , more specifically in studying the vulnerabilities of NLP systems from various adversarial perspectives and quantifying and analyzing the robustness of models.<br>

Apart from my Research work, I am also the Head of the [Analytics Club](https://github.com/analytics-club-iitm) at IIT Madras, it's one of the most active and sought after clubs in the Institue that works on topics pertaining to AI/ML.We are actively working on projects in 3 broad fields of AI, with the aim of solving some social problems. We also conduct various sessions/lecture series on topics related to ML. For futher info visit our Github organization(We try our best to keep it upto-date ;) <br> <br> Previously, I have got the oppurninity to contribute imensly to some early staged starups namely BlueBarrel Solutions in the US and NikkOtto at IITM. I am currently interning at Subex AI labs where I am working on document understanding tasks. <br><br><br>
