I'm a third year undergraduate in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Madras. I am currently working as an undegraduate researcher under [Prof Mitesh Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) at the Robert Bosch Center for Data Science, IIT Madras.<br> My research interests mainly lie in Natural Language Processing, more specifically in studying the vulnerabilities of NLP systems from various adversarial perspectives, quantifying and analyzing the robustness of models.I am also interested in building efficient NLP models.<br>

Apart from my research work, I am also the Head of the [Analytics Club](https://github.com/analytics-club-iitm) at IIT Madras, it's one of the most active and sought after clubs in the University that works on topics pertaining to AI/ML. We are actively working on projects in 3 broad fields of AI, with the aim of solving some social problems. We also conduct various sessions/lecture series on topics related to ML. For further info visit our Github organization(We try our best to keep it upto-date ;) <br> <br> Previously, I have got the opportunity to contribute immensely to some early staged startups namely BlueBarrel Solutions in the US and NikkOtto at IITM. I also interned at Subex where I worked on structured document understanding tasks. <br><br><br>
