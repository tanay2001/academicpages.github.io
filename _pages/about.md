I'm a senior undergraduate in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Madras. My research interests mainly lie in the applications of Deep Learning to various settings like Natural Language Processing. I am working on studying the vulnerabilities of systems from various adversarial perspectives, quantifying and analyzing the robustness of models.<br> I have worked as an undergraduate researcher under [Prof. Mitesh Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) at the Robert Bosch Center for Data Science and AI, IIT Madras. During the Fall of 2022, I interned remotely at the University of Washington's [H2lab](https://h2lab.cs.washington.edu/), where I worked with [Bhargavi Paranjape](https://bhargaviparanjape.github.io/) on topics related to counterfactual data augmentation in NLP. I was fortunate to be chosen as a NSF REU site Intern at [USC Information Science Institute](https://www.isi.edu/) for the summer of 2022. I'll be working with [Prof. Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) and [Ehsan Qasemi](https://proska.github.io/).

Aside from my research, I was the head of the [Analytics Club](https://github.com/analytics-club-iitm) at IIT Madras for '21-22; it's one of the most active and sought-after groups in the University, working actively to affect real-world problems by utilizing Machine Learning. For further info visit our Github organization. I still continue to contribute by being a memeber of the Student Council.<br> <br> Previously, I have got the opportunity to contribute immensely to some early staged startups namely BlueBarrel Solutions in the US and NikkOtto at IITM. I also interned at [Subex](https://www.subex.com/ai-labs/) where I worked with Vision & Language models with aim of automating the invoice verification process. <br><br>
